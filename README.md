# 42Piscine
All codes written for the 42 School Singapore's selection phase (piscine)

42 is a tuition-free computer science / ICT training institute founded by french billionaire Xavier Niel to make tech education accessible to people from all walks of life. To test if applicants are truly committed, they have to undergo the Piscine, and are only admitted into the school upon passing it.
The Piscine involves 26 days of completing coding assignments, group projects and exams, all in the C programming language.

This repository contains all codes that I have written for the individual assignments. In total there are 16 (2 for Linux Shell topics and 14 for C). I have attempted 2/2 Shell topics and 9/14 C topics. Within each topic there may be up to 12 sub-assignments (ex00 - ex12), starting from ethe easiest to the hardest.

A rough breakdown of the topics attempted are as follows:
- Shell00: Basic Shell, git commands and utilities
- Shell01: Basic Shell, git commands and utilities
- C00: Basic C syntax, if-else, while loops, printing to standard output
- C01: Basic C syntax, if-else, while loops, printing to standard output
- C02: Replicating system string functions, convert character cases (e.g. strcpy, lowertoupper)
- C03: Replicating system string functions (e.g. strncmp, strcat)
- C04: Working with type conversions (e.g. ascii to integer)
- C05: Recursion & Iterative loops
- C06: Commandline arguments
- C07: Dynamic Memory Allocation (malloc & free)
- C08: Header files & Structs
